This is a python script and accompanying report written for Sistemas Inteligentes at FCUL. The comments and  variable names are in Portuguese. Ran on it's own, it does not do anything (as it is quite computationally intensive). To generate results, the method Gerar_Ficheiros can be called to create .csv files containing the statistics for each algorithm on each test case. The results of this method call will be included in a .zip file. I collaborated with Antonio Ajuda (https://github.com/AntonioAjuda) on this project.
